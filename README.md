deploy their own applications.

### 2.1 - Where to Start

Covering the basics of simple coding can be done in a day, but basic competency usually takes
months, and mastery takes years. For this reason, if one seeks to develop a simple technical
project without devoting themselves to acquiring serious coding skills, one may resort to a
plethora of emerging automated tools to assist them.

Such tools fall into two broad categories: low-code platforms, and AI assistants. Low code
platforms are tools where applications may be developed and scripted using visual editors, such as
wix.com. AI assistants take verbal prompts from users and convert them into text-based code. Any
LLM chatbot, such as ChatGPT, can generate code when prompted, but some tools, such as GitHub
Copilot, are built directly into code editors. The use of AI assistants to develop software with
minimal manual development is often referred to as "vibe coding".

Low-code platforms are generally easier than vibe coding, as vibe coding usually does require at
least a rudimentary understanding of code structure and coding environments. That said, they are
usually limited to a singular task, and the apps developed with them are not portable to other
tools and platforms. Therefore, for a one-time experiment, using a low-code platform may ease the
learning curve. But if one wishes to pursue any further learning or improvement to their coding
skills, vibe coding may be the better starting point.

Listed in this guide are links to online learning resources for low-code platforms, general coding
knowledge, and vibe coding. All tools listed are free to use.
